1.  Check `logs`.

        $ kubectl logs forest-1

Or, alternatively, `grep` only the lines you want to see.

        $ kubectl logs forest-1 | grep -i user5
            [2022-03-03 23:32:44,669] WARNING in event-simulator: USER5 ðŸ‘ˆ Failed to Login as the account is locked due to MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS.

2.  By checking logs, figure out the cause of user complaint (cannot place a purchase order).

        $ kubectl logs forest-2 birch-garden

        Login as the account is locked due to MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS.
